        boring. We bring you the best from leading european specialty roasteries, currently mostly from
        <a href="https://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/">Square Mile Coffee Roasters</a>, a multi award winning coffee roasting company 
                    based in East London.

        <p>redcurrant / honeysuckle / juicy</p>
        <p>
            Fruity redcurrant and sweet honeysuckle flavours. An incredibly juicy coffee which we struggled to decide on the right
            berry descriptor, but raspberry, blackberry and blueberry were also in the running!

        <p>
            Fruity, sweet notes of dried mango, strawberry and passionfruit sit alongside a delicious creamy mouthfeel making this a
            tasty summer Ethiopian, hot or cold.

        <p>blackberry / orange / silky</p>
        <p>
            This is one fruit filled espresso! From citrus fruits, such as orange, grapefruit and clementine, to berries of the
            black, blue and red variety, this is fruit turned up to 11, all wrapped up in a silky smooth body.

        <p>caramel / apple / cinnamon</p>
        <p>
            This is a single origin espresso from San Carlos in El Salvador, think sweet caramel and apple notes alongside
            sprinklings of cinnamon in the finish.
